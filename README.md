# DMCP:DFT-based Machine learning method for Captureing Property Relationship with Structures
DMCP is aimed to implement DFT-based and Machine-learning-accelerated (DFT-ML) scheme for captureing QSPR in intricate system . It is possible to predict the property of intricate system  such as HEAs and to reveal the intrinsic descriptors which determine the underlying property of them with appropriate algorithm and train data features.
# Developer:
DMCP is developed within Prof. Yuzheng Guo's group in Wuhan University, in colloboration with Prof. John Robertson's group in Cambridge University.
Core developer: Xuhao Wan, Yuzheng Guo
Email: xhwanrm@whu.edu.cn, yguo@whu.edu.cn
# Major Features
1. Ten machine learning algorithms: GBR, KNR, SVR, GPR, FNN, RFR, ETR, KRR, LASSO, and ENR.
2. Multiple methods to improve model accuracy: dataset split, cross validation, repeated trails. 
3. Visualization module for research.
# Prerequisites
1. Generally, you need some data obtained from DFT calculations such as VASP, QE, and CP2K or available material database.
2. DMCP requires Python 3 with the packages specified in requirements.txt. This is taken care of by pip.
